This project was implemented in the language Python.

To execute this program:
  1) Open seperate terminal windows or command lines.
  2) cd into the project folder.
    a. One terminal should be in client.py
    b. Other terminal should be in server.py
  3) The terminal in the client.py dir, in the command line enter "python client.py"
  4) The terminal in the server.py dir, in the command line enter "python server.py"
  
  Testing Output - The client should prompt the user to enter a ftp command: get, put, ls, or quit. 
  Test the put first in order to get a file from server. It makes more sense.
